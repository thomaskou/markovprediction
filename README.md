# markovprediction
Rudimentary Markov chain predictor written in Java.

***

**Current functionality:**

- File input/output.
- Read and calculate the frequency of both current and succeeding digits.
- Store information in a data file.  
- Output a sequence of digits based on the data.  

**To do (short term):**
- Calculate the probability of completing a number sequence after *n* digits.
- Randomly terminate a number sequence based on probability.

**To do (long term):**

- Implement a chain prediction based solely on raw word input (no punctuation, grammar, syntax).  
- Refine word prediction to include multiple sentences (capitalization, punctuation).  
- Implement basic grammatical syntax and punctuation.
