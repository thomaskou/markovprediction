**Current functionality:**

- File input/output.

**To do (short term):**

- Read and calculate the frequency of both current and succeeding digits.  
- Calculate the probability of completing a number sequence after *n* digits.  
- Store information in a data file.  
- Output a sequence of digits based on the data.  

**To do (long term):**

- Implement a chain prediction based solely on raw word input (no punctuation, grammar, syntax).  
- Refine word prediction to include multiple sentences (capitalization, punctuation).  
- Implement basic grammatical syntax and punctuation.
