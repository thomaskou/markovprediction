# markovprediction
Rudimentary Markov chain predictor written in Java.

***

**Current functionality:**

- Fully implemented Markov chain prediction for numerical digits.
- Rudimentary implementation of Markov chain prediction based solely on raw word input (ignoring capitalization, punctuation, etc).
- Read from a file input, calculate the frequency of both current and succeeding items, and store information in a data file.
- Output a sequence of words or digits based on the data.

**To do (short term):**
- Calculate the probability of completing a sequence after *n* words/digits.
- Randomly terminate a sequence based on probability.

**To do (long term):**

- Refine word prediction to include multiple sentences (capitalization, punctuation).  
- Implement basic grammatical syntax and punctuation.
